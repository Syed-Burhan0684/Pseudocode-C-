CodeShift: C++ ↔ Pseudocode Translator
Overview
CodeShift is an AI-powered tool that translates between C++ and pseudocode using a transformer model. Built with PyTorch and deployed via Hugging Face Spaces, it’s ideal for developers and educators.

Features
Bidirectional translation (C++ → Pseudocode, Pseudocode → C++).
Interactive web interface with a coding-themed design.
Efficient transformer-based architecture.
Prerequisites
Python 3.11+
PyTorch, Streamlit, torchtext, numpy
Installation
Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/Syed-Burhan0684/Pseudocode-C-.git
cd Pseudocode-C-
Set up a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run locally:
streamlit run app.py
Enter C++ or pseudocode in the web interface to translate.

Deployment on Hugging Face Spaces
Push your code to GitHub.
Go to huggingface.co/spaces, sign in with GitHub, and create a new Space:
Repository: Syed-Burhan0684/Pseudocode-C-
Branch: master (or your branch name)
Main file: app.py
Deploy the Space, and access your app at a URL like huggingface.co/spaces/Syed-Burhan0684/Pseudocode-C-.
Known Issues
Translations may repeat tokens (e.g., = 10 = 10...). Fix by retraining the model or adjusting translate in app.py.
